## Prerequisites
To install and use this project, you will need to have the following prerequisites:

- GNU COBOL: The GNU COBOL compiler is required to compile and run COBOL programs. You can install it by following the instructions on the [GNU COBOL website](https://sourceforge.net/projects/open-cobol/).


- GNU Make: GNU Make is a build automation tool that is commonly used to compile and build projects. You can install it by following the instructions for your operating system:


    - For Linux: GNU Make is usually pre-installed on most Linux distributions. You can check if it is installed by running the command `make --version` in your terminal. If it is not installed, you can install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run `sudo apt-get install build-essential` to install GNU Make.

    - For macOS: GNU Make is not pre-installed on macOS. You can install it using package managers like Homebrew or MacPorts. For example, with Homebrew, you can run `brew install make` to install GNU Make.

    - For Windows: GNU Make is not natively available on Windows. However, you can install it using tools like Cygwin or MinGW. Cygwin provides a large collection of GNU and Open Source tools which provide functionality similar to a Linux distribution on Windows. MinGW is a minimalist development environment for native Microsoft Windows applications. You can choose either of these tools and follow their respective installation instructions to install GNU Make.

Once you have installed GNU COBOL and GNU Make, you will be ready to proceed with the installation of this project.
